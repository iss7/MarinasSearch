# MarinasSearch

## App Description
This is a simple app that displays Points of Interest from the Marinas.com API. Users can enter a search term to find relevant points, or can select a category of interest point to find all interest points of that category near them. (Note that users on an iPhone simulator will be shown points near Cupertino, CA.) 

Ideal future improvements:
- User login so that users can save/favorite various points of interest 
- Display more data about each point 
- Map view to show relative locations to points (as well as user location)
- Display reviews without going to Marinas.com
- Integration with some mapping software to provide directions to nearby interest points

## Setup Instructions
The app can be run via an Xcode simulator or can be loaded onto an iPhone from Xcode. It is compatible with Xcode versions 13.0 and above.

The app uses Snapkit for some UI layout features. This should automatically work without additional installation steps.
